# Formula Clicker

A simplistic clicker game inspired by **Exponential Idle** and **Candy Box 2**.

The main control is to click the point button (you can also press space or shift) to earn points.

You then buy upgrades and such to enhance your point gain, and get further in the game.

Later in the game, it gets more complex as you unlock new features, such as a side game that can influence the main game, or a prestige mechanic.

Eventually, after hours of rich gameplay (I would not recommend playing it all in one sitting), you will reach the end of the game.

*However... I wonder if what seems to be the end... is truly the end...*

## Notes

- You don't start with an options menu, but you unlock it later.

- Uses Patashu's `break_eternity.js` for big numbers.

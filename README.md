# Formula Clicker

A simplistic clicker game inspired by **Exponential Idle** and **Candy Box 2**.

Later in the game, it gets more complex as you unlock new features, such as a side game that can influence the main game, or a prestige mechanic.

Eventually, after hours of rich gameplay (I would not recommend playing it all in one sitting) you will reach the end of the game.

*However... I wonder if what seems to be the end... is truly the end...*

> Note: you don't start with an options menu, but you unlock it later.

> Another note: uses Patashu's `break_eternity.js` for big numbers.
>
> In hindsight, `break_infinity.js` would have worked too. Oh well.

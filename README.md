# Formula Clicker

A simplistic clicker game inspired by **Exponential Idle** and **Candy Box 2**.

Currently you complete the game at 1.798e308 points, but more content will be added over the course of time.

NOTE: multiple saves have not been implemented yet, but if you open the console you can use `exportSave("console")` and `importSave(*paste save here*)` to manually change saves, as well has `hardReset()` to wipe your current save.
